# Lab Report: Migration Plan for Del Monte Foods Inc.

## Company’s Motivators for Migration to the Cloud

Del Monte Foods Inc. migrated to Microsoft Azure to address several key issues with their previous cloud infrastructure, including high costs, complexity, and performance bottlenecks. The main motivators were:
- **Cost Reduction:** Lowering expensive and complicated maintenance.
- **Performance Improvement:** Overcoming performance issues and scalability limitations.
- **Enhanced Security:** Addressing rising cyber threats and compliance needs.
- **Minimal Disruption:** Avoiding downtime in their time-sensitive food processing operations.

## Questions to Understand the Company’s Setup

To plan the migration effectively, we need to answer the following:
1. What systems and software are currently used (e.g., ERP, databases)?
2. What specific performance and scalability issues are present?
3. What security measures and compliance requirements must be met?
4. How is data currently backed up and what are the recovery objectives?
5. Are there any third-party applications or systems that need integration?
6. What are the peak operational times to minimize migration impact?

## Most Likely Migration Approach

The **“Lift-and-Shift”** approach is ideal for Del Monte. This strategy involves moving existing systems to Azure with minimal changes to quickly realize the benefits of the new infrastructure. After the migration, the company can then focus on optimizing and refining the setup for enhanced performance and cost savings.

## High-Level Schedule for the Migration Process

| Phase                   | Duration            | Key Activities                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Planning & Assessment**  | 2 weeks             | Review current systems, plan migration strategy, and allocate resources. |
| **Design & Architecture**  | 3 weeks             | Design Azure setup, configure network, security, and backup plans. |
| **Migration Execution**    | 3 months            | Move systems to Azure, integrate with third-party apps, and ensure everything works. |
| **Testing & Validation**    | 2 weeks             | Test the new setup, fix issues, and optimize performance. |
| **Security Implementation** | 2 weeks             | Set up Microsoft Defender, apply security measures, and ensure compliance. |
| **Post-Migration Support**  | Ongoing             | Monitor performance, provide support, and make improvements as needed. |

## Main Decision Criteria

- **Cost Efficiency:** Migration should reduce infrastructure and operational costs.
- **Performance Improvement:** Systems should perform better and scale more effectively.
- **Enhanced Security:** Security measures should improve and comply with regulations.
- **Minimal Downtime:** Migration should cause minimal disruption to operations.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** System should be flexible and scalable to adapt to business needs.

This plan ensures that Del Monte achieves its goals with a structured approach to migration, minimizing disruption while maximizing benefits from Azure’s capabilities.
