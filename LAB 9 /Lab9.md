   - Scheduled batch jobs for data processing.

6. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Redundant storage for disaster recovery.
   - Geo-redundant storage across all regions.

7. **Management and Monitoring Tools:**
   - Monitoring system for uptime, performance metrics, and security alerts.
   - Budgeting and cost management tools.

## Cost Estimates

### 1. Migration Cost
- **Data Transfer Costs:** Estimated at $0.09 per GB for transferring 50 TB of data to AWS.
- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):** Estimated at $0.10 per DMS replication hour, with 30 hours for initial setup and migration across three regions.
- **Temporary Compute Resources:** Estimated at $0.20 per hour for 5 EC2 instances for migration assistance (total for 30 hours).

**Total Migration Cost:** **$7,050**

### 2. Operational Cost
#### a. Web Front-End Cluster
- **EC2 Instances:** 
  - 30 VMs (10 per region) at an average cost of $0.20 per hour for general-purpose instances.
  - Total: $0.20 * 24 hours * 30 days * 3 regions = **$4,320 per month**.
- **Load Balancers:** Estimated at $0.0225 per hour plus $0.008 per GB processed.

#### b. API Back-End Services
- **EC2 Instances:** 
  - 20 VMs at an average cost of $0.25 per hour.
  - Total: $0.25 * 24 hours * 30 days = **$4,500 per month**.

#### c. Payment Processing
- **High-Security VMs:** 
  - 10 VMs at an average cost of $0.30 per hour.
  - Total: $0.30 * 24 hours * 30 days = **$7,200 per month**.

#### d. Database Layer
- **Primary Database (RDS):** 
  - 5 TB at $0.15 per GB.
  - Total: $0.15 * 5,000 GB = **$750 per month**.
- **Analytics Database (DynamoDB):** 
  - 10 TB at $0.25 per GB.
  - Total: $0.25 * 10,000 GB = **$2,500 per month**.
- **Data Warehouse (Redshift):** 
  - 15 TB at $0.25 per GB.
  - Total: $0.25 * 15,000 GB = **$3,750 per month**.

#### e. Data Analytics and ML Processing
- **GPU-enabled EC2 Instances:** 
  - 5 instances at $3.06 per hour for ML processing.
  - Total: $3.06 * 24 hours * 30 days = **$2,200 per month**.

#### f. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- **S3 Storage:** 
  - 50 TB at $0.023 per GB.
  - Total: $0.023 * 50,000 GB = **$1,150 per month**.

#### g. Management and Monitoring Tools
- **CloudWatch and Cost Explorer:** Estimated at **$300 per month**.

### Total Monthly Operational Cost
- Web Front-End Cluster: $4,320
- API Back-End Services: $4,500
- Payment Processing: $7,200
- Database Layer: $750 + $2,500 + $3,750 = $7,000
- Data Analytics and ML Processing: $2,200
- Backup and Disaster Recovery: $1,150
- Management and Monitoring: $300

**Total Operational Cost:** **$26,470 per month**

### 3. Management Cost
- Estimated at **$1,000 per month** for management tools, security management, and monitoring services.

### Total Monthly Management Cost
**Total Management Cost:** **$1,000 per month**

### Total Estimated Monthly Costs
- **Total Monthly Cost = Operational Cost + Management Cost**
- **Total = $26,470 + $1,000 = $27,470 per month**

## Cost Optimization Strategy
- **Reserved Instances:** Estimated savings of 30% compared to on-demand pricing for EC2 and RDS instances.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Implementing auto-scaling for VMs can reduce costs during off-peak periods by only running necessary instances.
- **Right-Sizing Instances:** Analyze instance performance and adjust types or sizes to optimize usage and reduce costs.
- **Use of Savings Plans:** Consider AWS Savings Plans for predictable workloads to achieve further discounts.

## Future Growth and Budget Plan
- **Three-Year Cost Projection:** 
  - Year 1: $27,470/month = $329,640
  - Year 2: Estimated 10% growth = $362,600
  - Year 3: Estimated additional 10% growth = $398,860

- **Potential Optimizations:** Shift towards serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) for certain workloads, potentially reducing costs further.

## Conclusion
This cost estimation report provides a detailed breakdown of the anticipated expenses associated with migrating ShopPro International's infrastructure to AWS. The outlined strategies for cost optimization and future growth projections will assist in managing and potentially reducing overall expenditures while ensuring robust performance and scalability for the company's needs.
